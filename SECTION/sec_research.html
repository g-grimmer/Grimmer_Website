      <b>Data</b>:
      The dataset was collected in the field using two PTZ cameras placed upstream and downstream of the Steingiessen River.
      It contains 6,013 RGB images.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Study Object</b>:
      This study focuses on monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in rivers, a growing environmental concern due to its impacts on biodiversity, water quality, and human activities. 
      Developing automated detection and measurement methods is essential to enable continuous, reliable, and low-cost monitoring of these pollutants in real-world conditions.

        <b>Data</b>:
        Orthophotographs originate from the BD Ortho® IRC dataset produced by the French National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information (IGN).
        Acquired through aerial surveys, the dataset consists of three spectral bands (near-infrared, red, and green).

        <b>Study Object</b>:
        Studying in-stream wood is essential as it shapes river morphology, regulates sediment and flow dynamics, and enhances aquatic habitat diversity.
        It is key for understanding river ecosystem functioning and guiding sustainable river management.
