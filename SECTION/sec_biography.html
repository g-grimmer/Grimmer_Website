  <h2>About</h2>
  <p class="justified">
  I'm in my first year of PhD study at the University of Strasbourg.
  The aim of my research is to study the phenomena of river wood and anthropogenic debris in alluvial systems using deep learning and machine learning methods applied to image processing.
  During my university studies, I acquired a number of skills in the acquisition, management, processing and presentation of spatial data (geomatics).
  I have specialised in remote sensing and am currently acquiring robust skills in artificial intelligence methods.

  <strong>2024 — Research Internship (3 months)</strong><br />
  Image City Environment Laboratory (LIVE), UMR CNRS 7362 – Strasbourg (FR)<br />
  <p class="justified">
    Using false-color aerial imagery, this project focused on the detection and quantification of deadwood in fluvial hydrosystems through image classification using the Random Forest method. The work concluded with the development of an automated tool for detecting and quantifying deadwood.
